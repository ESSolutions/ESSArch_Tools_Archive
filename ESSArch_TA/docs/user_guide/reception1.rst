Use the select dropdown to choose what submission agreement to use.
If the dropdown is disabled, the IP already has a related Submission agreement.

When selection of Submission agreement is done.
Check the **Approved to receive**-checkbox and click **Receive SIP**.
The process of receiving the IP is started and if more IPs are included a
receive window for the next IP will appear.
An IP can be skipped by clicking the **Skip**-button,
then the receive window for the next included IP will appear,
if there is one.

When IP is received it is no longer visible in the reception list view and
can be found in either Workarea list views or the list view in Transfer SIP.
